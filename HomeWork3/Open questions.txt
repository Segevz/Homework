1.	In general, why do we expect feature scaling to have a positive effect on our kNN algorithm? Would we expect to have a positive effect of feature scaling in the context of decision tree algorithms?

Answer: We expect feature scaling to have a positive effect on our KNN algorithm, due to the limitation of the range (between -1 to 1 for example).
		If we don't scale, then a spcific feature which has a broad range of possible values (for example 0-1000000), will behave as a strong mass of our calculation.
		Therefore, that kind of feature can influence significantly on our prediction, rather than the other features, which should also be taken in count.

2.	In class we saw we can perform an edited kNN algorihtm which used either backward or forward kNN to filter out instances.
Could we use this procedure for our dataset? If so explain how, if not explain why.
